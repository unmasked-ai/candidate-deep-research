# Frontend Implementation Orchestrator

## Overview
This document serves as the master orchestrator for implementing the candidate deep research frontend. It provides a systematic approach to building a React TypeScript application that integrates with the existing Coral Protocol multi-agent backend system.

## Project Scope
- **Input**: LinkedIn URL, CV file upload, Job Description (text or file upload)
- **Processing**: Multi-agent pipeline orchestrated by Coral Protocol
- **Output**: Match evaluation score and detailed justification from match-evaluation agent
- **No Templates**: Skipping template management system for this iteration

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Planning Documents)
**Status**: Current Phase
- âœ… Directory structure created
- ðŸ”„ Writing comprehensive planning documents
- ðŸ“‹ Clear specifications for each component layer

### Phase 2: Backend Integration
**Dependency**: Complete Phase 1
- Update existing FastAPI backend to handle file uploads
- Integrate match-evaluation agent as final step in pipeline
- Maintain existing Coral Protocol orchestration

### Phase 3: Frontend Development
**Dependency**: Complete Phase 2 planning docs
- React TypeScript project setup
- Component implementation following specifications
- API integration and state management

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
**Dependency**: Complete Phase 3
- End-to-end testing
- Error handling and validation
- Performance optimization

## Key Principles

### 1. Document-Driven Development
Each component and feature must have detailed specifications in planning documents before implementation. This prevents scope creep and ensures systematic development.

### 2. Backend-First Integration
The backend must be fully functional with file upload support and match-evaluation integration before frontend implementation begins.

### 3. Component-Driven Architecture
Build reusable, well-tested components that follow the existing patterns and can be easily maintained.

### 4. Coral Protocol Compliance
Maintain compatibility with existing Coral Protocol orchestration patterns and agent communication protocols.

## Implementation Flow

### Current Phase: Planning Documents
1. **orchestrator.md** (this document) - Master guide âœ…
2. **01-project-setup.md** - React TypeScript project configuration
3. **02-ui-components.md** - Base UI component specifications
4. **03-input-form.md** - Input component specifications (LinkedIn, CV, JD)
5. **04-processing-flow.md** - Loading and progress tracking components
6. **05-results-display.md** - Results visualization components
7. **06-api-integration.md** - HTTP client and API communication
8. **07-state-management.md** - React Context and state patterns
9. **08-validation.md** - Input validation and error handling
10. **09-responsive-design.md** - UI/UX and accessibility guidelines
11. **10-deployment.md** - Build and deployment configuration

### Backend Enhancement Phase
1. **File Upload Support** - Add multipart form data handling
2. **Pipeline Integration** - Add match-evaluation as final agent
3. **API Endpoints** - Update endpoints for new input types

### Frontend Development Phase
1. **Project Setup** - Create React TypeScript application
2. **Base Components** - Implement reusable UI components
3. **Input Components** - LinkedIn URL, CV upload, JD input
4. **Processing Components** - Loading states and progress tracking
5. **Results Components** - Score visualization and justification display
6. **Integration** - API communication and state management

## Quality Gates

### Planning Phase Gate
- All 11 planning documents completed with detailed specifications
- Architecture decisions documented and reviewed
- Component interfaces clearly defined

### Backend Phase Gate
- File upload endpoints functional
- Match-evaluation agent integrated into pipeline
- API documentation updated

### Frontend Phase Gate
- All components implemented according to specifications
- Integration tests passing
- UI/UX requirements met

### Final Integration Gate
- End-to-end testing complete
- Error handling robust
- Performance benchmarks met

## Key Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Coral Protocol server running and accessible
- Match-evaluation agent functional
- Existing multi-agent pipeline operational

### Internal Dependencies
- Planning documents as implementation blueprints
- Backend file upload support before frontend file handling
- Component specifications before component implementation

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- âœ… User can input LinkedIn URL, upload CV, and provide job description
- âœ… System processes inputs through multi-agent pipeline
- âœ… Match-evaluation agent returns score and justification
- âœ… Results displayed in clear, professional interface

### Technical Requirements
- âœ… React TypeScript implementation
- âœ… Responsive design with accessibility compliance
- âœ… Robust error handling and validation
- âœ… Integration with existing Coral Protocol backend

### Quality Requirements
- âœ… Clean, maintainable code following established patterns
- âœ… Comprehensive testing coverage
- âœ… Performance optimized for file uploads and processing
- âœ… Professional UI/UX meeting design specifications

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **File Upload Complexity**: Detailed specification in planning docs
- **Agent Integration**: Backend-first approach ensures compatibility
- **State Management**: Clear patterns documented before implementation

### Project Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Document-driven approach with clear boundaries
- **Integration Issues**: Phased approach with quality gates
- **Timeline Pressure**: Systematic approach with reusable components

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Complete remaining planning documents (01-10)
2. **Phase 2**: Update backend with file upload and agent integration
3. **Phase 3**: Implement frontend following planning specifications
4. **Phase 4**: Integration testing and optimization

## Communication Protocol

### Progress Tracking
- Todo list updated after each completed task
- Quality gates verified before phase transitions
- Documentation updated with implementation decisions

### Review Points
- Planning document review before backend phase
- Backend integration review before frontend phase
- Component review during frontend implementation
- Final integration review before deployment

This orchestrator ensures systematic, quality-driven implementation that integrates seamlessly with the existing Coral Protocol architecture while delivering a professional user experience.
