The Company

My client is a VC-backed scale-up delivering advanced solutions in environmental risk, climate analytics, and asset protection.

With deep connections to NGOs, government agencies, consultancies, and financial institutions, the company is on a mission to transform how the world measures and manages risk in some of the most challenging natural environments.


The Role

The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) will:
Lead and grow a high-performing technical function in a hands-on and strategic capacity, initially managing two senior engineers and then building out the team post-funding.
Set and deliver the technical product roadmap in direct partnership with the CEO and commercial leads.
Combine advanced geospatial, data science, and cloud engineering know-how to take new products from concept through to scalable production.
Play an influential role in commercial discussions, customer engagement, sales support, investor relations, and cross-functional strategy.
Ensure that technical decisions are pragmatic, commercially aligned, and sustainable as the company grows.
Split time between technical hands-on work and strategic leadership, especially in the initial phase as the team builds.


Essential Requirements

PhD in a technical or scientific field related to remote sensing, geospatial science, earth sciences, or statistics.
Significant experience as a technical lead, engineering manager, or CTO within a geospatial, earth observation, or environmental analytics company.
A Statistical background - knowledge of Bayesian modelling for example
Proven record with remote sensing, data science, and machine learning – minimum 8 years.
Mastery of Python and experience with spatial/temporal/physical modeling in production environments.
Familiarity with geospatial technologies such as QGIS, PostGIS, LiDAR, and high-volume geo data pipeline development.
Experience working in a Pre-Seed, Seed, or Series A stage startup.
Demonstrated leadership and mentoring skills, including helping build and upskill technical teams.
Commercial product delivery experience from early-stage development through to scale-up.
Exceptional communication skills; adept at translating technical topics to commercial and investor audiences.
Based in London, or able to commute to Central London 2–3 days per week.


What Will Make You Stand Out

Exposure to both public and private sector innovation cycles (regulators, NGOs, government clients, insurance, finance).
Early, hands-on team-building experience: directly hiring, onboarding, and developing engineers or scientists.
Entrepreneurial mindset – bringing solutions-orientation, curiosity, and a drive to make a real-world difference.
Background in both product management and technical leadership, or having worked as both CTO and product owner.
Prior experience connecting end users with commercial clients in multidisciplinary environments.
